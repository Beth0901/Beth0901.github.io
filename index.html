							<h2>Evaluation of project</h2>
							<p>This section will discuss the positives, in the left-hand columns, and the negatives, in the right-hand columns, of this project.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									
									<h3>Skills and knowledge learnt</h3>
									<p>This project allowed for numerous skills to be learnt across the various technologies discussed. As well as this a range of knowledge on new topics was learnt such as learning about the properties of different 3D filaments. These skills and knowledge are valuable knowledge to have for creating similar projects in the future.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Difference in final design</h3>
									<p>A downside to this project was that the final design achieved did not meet the intended design specification set out by the team. This means that it did not meet expectations with the final product.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
		
									<h3>Finished product</h3>
									<p>One positive of the project is that there was a final artefact to show. Although it does not function as intended nor meet the original designs, each component is still physically made.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Lack of articulation</h3>
									<p>The end product of the project did not have articulation as it was intended to. This lack of articulation is a major downside to the project and means it did not meet the necessary requirements for the project.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
								
									<h3>Getting to use different technologies</h3>
									<p>This project didn't only teach new skills but it also gave access to actively using technology that may not be available to use commonly. This gave a good practical experience for the design team to get used to the technologies that might not have ever been used if not for this project.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Time contraints</h3>
									<p>A major factor that affected the end result of this project was the time constraints. This was an issue as it limited the time available to tweak the stls for printing meaning that other alternative routes needed to be explored. If more time was available a more polished version of the artefact would have been created.</p>
