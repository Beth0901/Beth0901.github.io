							<h1 class="major">Development of articulated parrot from start to finish</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/PictureCombine.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This page will cover the artefact's design, development and final production.</p>
							<h2>Design</h2>
							<p>This project aimed to develop a 3D articulated model of a parrot.
							<br>This model consists of 5 separate pieces that would be constructed together to create the final piece.
							<br>The 5 pieces are the Head, the chest plate, the lower body, the concentric cam, and perch. The intended idea was to create each of these in either Blender or Fusion360.
							For the articulation, the concentric cam would be connected to the chest plate to push it outwards and would make it look as if the bird was breathing.
							</p>
							<h2>Available technologies</h2>
								<p>There were 7 types of technology available to create this project.</p>
							<h3>Motion capture</h3>
							<p>Motion capture is a technique used to record the movement of people and objects. This involves tracking the actor or object's movement and then using this data to generate this movement in a computer-generated environment.
							<br> For this technology to work actors must wear special suits and be covered with markers. These markers will reflect the light emitted by cameras placed around the capture area.
							<br>A few common uses for motion capture are Video games, Virtual reality, and TV & film.
							<br>This technology was unsuitable for designing the parrot model as it was not possible to bring in a live parrot to capture its movement.
							</p>	
							<h3>CAD and 3D modelling</h3>
							<p>For this project two options were available, Blender and Fusion360.
							<br>Both these softwares allow the user to create digital representations of objects or surfaces.
							However, Fusion360 is primarily used for tasks that are more geared towards engineering e.g. creating gears, while Blender is more focused on animation and rendering scenes.
							For this project, both of these softwares were used for 3D modelling of the parrot.Fusion360 was used to model the concentric cam, and Blender was used to model the other parts of the body.
							This choice was made as Fusion is good for engineering projects and the cam consists of moving objects so it was perfect for this task. While Blender is better for the creation of the other parts as it is animation-geared, so it was good for the aesthetic side.

							<p>The stl above shows the initial Blender design of the parrot which was designed by another member of the development team due to their prior knowledge of the software.</p>
							<h3>3D scanning</h3>
							<p>3D scanning is used to capture the shape and appearance of a real-world object and convert it into a digital model.
							<br>The scanner available for this project was a laser scanner which uses laser beams to measure the distance to the surface of an object. This allows them to capture detailed geometric information allowing them to be used on complex shapes.
							<br>3D scanning has a lot of uses such as quality control and reverse engineering.
							<br>This technology was not employed for the project as a real parrot would not be possible to scan and purchasing a model parrot would not be an optimal use of the artefacts budget, as it can be easily created using other methods for a lower cost.
							</p>
							<h3>3D printing</h3>
							<p>For this project there was a range of filaments that could be used to print the artefact.
							<br>The filament types available were PLA, ABS, Resin, Nylon and Carbon fibre.
							The types actively considered for this project were PLA, ABS and Resin. However, PLA and Resin were the final choices for printing materials.
							PLA and ABS are very similar in terms of uses and weight, however, PLA is cheaper to print and was therefore chosen.
							Resin was selected to print the concentric cam as Resin is good for smaller, detailed prints, and as the cam is small this is the perfect filament choice.
							PLA was selected to print the majority of the artefact as it is cheap and lightweight. One downside to PLA is it cannot have a lot of sun exposure as it will become brittle, but this project is designed for indoor use so this is not much of an issue.	
							</p>
							<h3>Resin and silicon</h3>
							<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/resin.jpg" alt="" data-position="center center" height=350 width=420 /></a>
							<p>The image shows the two different types of resin that are available. The left and middle images show polyurethane (poly) resin and the right image shows epoxy resin</p>
							The two types of resin differ massively as polyurethane can be de-moulded within 20 minutes of being poured, while epoxy requires a setting time of 48 hours. Both types can be dyed with different colour pigments, however poly will set white and epoxy will set clear.
							As well as this they have completely different working times with epoxy having a 10-minute work time while poly only has 2 minutes.
							Silicon rubber was also available to use for this project. The silicon available for this project can be used as a fake skin covering or can be used to create moulds. This silicon takes around 24 hours to fully cure, and may require a vacuum chamber to degas the silicon to remove any air bubbles.
							For this project, both silicon and resin were considered. The initial design was to create the face plate of the bird out of resin by creating a silicon mould of the 3d printing face plate. Once the mould is created epoxy resin would have been used and coloured cream and left to set.
							However, due to time constraints, this idea was not completed and the face plate was printed in PLA instead.
